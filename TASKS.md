# TaskHub Implementation Plan

## Terminal Enhancement Features

### 1. Tab Completion for Commands
- [x] **Implement tab completion for commands and file paths**
  - Add tab completion functionality to the terminal interface. When the user presses Tab, complete the current command based on available commands, file paths, and task titles. Support partial matching and cycle through multiple completions with repeated tab presses. Support bash completions as well.
- [x] **Implement sub command completion like bash completions**
  - Allow sub command completion in the same way that bash completions work (possible use bash completion or similar
    for other shells by identifing the underlying shell). For example if I type `git che<tab>` I want it to complete to `git checkout`
- [x] **Improve tab completion**
  - Improve tab completion: In bash when I write `git checkout --<tab><tab>` it completes all the switches available. Lets support that as well.


### 2. Command History Navigation
- [x] **Implement arrow key command history navigation**
  - Add command history navigation using up/down arrow keys. When the user presses up arrow, replace the current input with the previous command from history. Down arrow should move forward through history. Preserve the current partial input when navigating.

### 3. Persistent Command History
- [x] **Implement persistent command history across sessions**
  - Save command history to disk and restore it when the application starts. Store history in a file within the user's data directory, with configurable history size limits. Include timestamps for each command.

### 4. Reverse History Search
- [x] **Implement Ctrl+R reverse history search**
  - Add Ctrl+R functionality to search through command history. Display a search prompt that filters history as the user types. Support navigating through matches and executing or editing selected commands.

### 5. Advanced Cursor Movement
- [x] **Add advanced cursor movement shortcuts**
  - Implement terminal-standard cursor movement shortcuts: Ctrl+A (beginning of line), Ctrl+E (end of line), Ctrl+F/B (forward/backward character), Ctrl+Left/Right (word-wise movement), and Ctrl+K (kill to end of line).

### 6. Clear Screen Functionality
- [x] **Implement clear screen command and shortcut**
  - Add a `/clear` command and Ctrl+L shortcut to clear the terminal screen while preserving command history. The clear should reset the display but maintain scroll history for users who want to scroll back.

### 7. Copy/Paste Support
- [x] **Add copy/paste functionality to terminal**
  - Implement text selection and copy/paste operations in the terminal. Support mouse selection of text, Ctrl+C to copy selected text, and Ctrl+V to paste. Handle clipboard operations across different platforms.

### 8. Auto-suggestions Based on History
- [x] **Implement auto-suggestions from command history**
  - Add inline auto-suggestions that appear as grayed-out text based on command history. As the user types, suggest the most recent matching command. Allow accepting suggestions with Tab or Right arrow.

### 9. Terminal Output Search
- [x] **Add search functionality for terminal output**
  - Implement Ctrl+F to search through the current terminal output. Display a search bar that highlights matches and allows navigation between results. Support case-sensitive and regex search options.

### 10. Terminal Theming Support
- [ ] **Implement terminal color themes and customization**
  - Add support for terminal color themes including command colors, output colors, error highlighting, and success indicators. Support both built-in themes and custom user themes via configuration files.

## Task Management Integration Features

### 11. Smart Task Completion
- [ ] **Add task-aware tab completion**
  - Enhance tab completion to include task titles, IDs, and status values when using task-related commands. Support completing task titles in quotes for tasks with spaces, and provide context-aware suggestions based on current command.

### 12. Quick Task Creation Shortcuts
- [ ] **Implement quick task creation syntax**
  - Add shorthand syntax for creating tasks directly in the terminal without using the `/task add` command. Support syntax like `+ Task title` or `>>> Task title` to quickly create tasks while maintaining full command functionality.

### 13. Task Search and Filter Commands
- [ ] **Add comprehensive task search and filtering**
  - Implement advanced task search commands like `/task search <query>`, `/task filter status:open`, and `/task find priority:high`. Support filtering by multiple criteria and saving common filter combinations.

### 14. Task Status Quick Updates
- [ ] **Implement quick task status updates**
  - Add shortcuts for common task operations like marking tasks complete, changing priority, or updating status. Support commands like `/done <task-id>`, `/high <task-id>`, and `/progress <task-id>` for rapid task management.

### 15. Context-Aware Command Suggestions
- [ ] **Add intelligent command suggestions based on context**
  - Implement smart command suggestions that adapt based on current directory, recent commands, and available tasks. Show relevant task operations when in project directories and suggest recently used commands.

## Advanced Terminal Features

### 16. Multi-line Input Support
- [ ] **Implement multi-line command input**
  - Add support for multi-line commands using continuation characters or explicit multi-line mode. Allow editing complex commands across multiple lines with proper indentation and syntax highlighting for shell scripts.

### 17. Command Aliases
- [ ] **Implement user-defined command aliases**
  - Add support for creating and managing command aliases. Allow users to define shortcuts for frequently used commands and store them in configuration. Support both simple and parameterized aliases.

### 18. Terminal Session Management
- [ ] **Add terminal session save/restore functionality**
  - Implement the ability to save terminal sessions including command history, current directory, and application state. Allow users to restore previous sessions and manage multiple named sessions.

### 19. Background Process Management
- [ ] **Implement background command execution**
  - Add support for running commands in the background using `&` syntax. Provide job control commands to list, manage, and interact with background processes. Show process status in the terminal interface.

### 20. Terminal Window Management
- [ ] **Add terminal split and tab functionality**
  - Implement terminal multiplexing with support for splitting the terminal into multiple panes or tabs. Allow running different commands in each pane and switching between them with keyboard shortcuts.
