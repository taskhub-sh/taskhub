## üìù Notes for Implementation

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality and iterate
2. **Test Early**: Write tests alongside code, not after
3. **User-Centric**: Always consider the developer user experience
4. **Performance First**: Optimize for speed from the beginning
5. **Security Focus**: Implement secure credential handling early
6. **Documentation**: Document as you build, not at the end
