# TaskHub Architecture

## Overview

TaskHub is designed as a modular, terminal-based application built in Rust. It follows a layered architecture to separate concerns and promote maintainability, performance, and security.

## System Components

### 1. CLI Application Layer

This layer handles user interaction through the terminal. It's responsible for:

- **Terminal Emulator (`crossterm`)**: Provides cross-platform terminal handling, including input (keyboard, mouse) and output (colors, cursor positioning).
- **TUI Framework (`ratatui`)**: Manages the rendering of the terminal user interface, including widgets, layouts, and views (e.g., task list, task detail).
- **Command Parser (`clap`)**: Parses command-line arguments and `/` prefixed commands entered by the user, dispatching them to the appropriate handlers.

### 2. Core Engine Layer

This is the heart of TaskHub, containing the main business logic and data management:

- **Task Manager**: Handles CRUD operations for tasks, including filtering, sorting, and bulk actions.
- **Sync Engine**: Manages bidirectional synchronization with external task sources, including conflict resolution and incremental updates.
- **Local Database (`sqlx` with SQLite)**: Persists task data locally, providing offline capabilities and fast access.

### 3. Integration Layer

This layer is responsible for communicating with external task management platforms:

- **API Clients (`reqwest`)**: Provides interfaces for interacting with various APIs (e.g., GitHub, Jira, GitLab).
- **Data Mapping**: Translates data between external API formats and TaskHub's internal `Task` model.

### 4. Configuration & Security Layer

This layer handles application settings and sensitive data:

- **Configuration Management (`config-rs`)**: Loads and manages user settings from configuration files (e.g., TOML).
- **Credential Management (`keyring`)**: Securely stores API tokens and other sensitive credentials using OS-specific keychains.

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: Commands are entered in the terminal, parsed by `clap`.
2. **Command Execution**: Parsed commands trigger actions in the Core Engine.
3. **Data Access**: The Core Engine interacts with the Local Database for task persistence.
4. **External Sync**: The Sync Engine uses Integration Layer clients to fetch/push data from/to external platforms.
5. **TUI Rendering**: The TUI Framework renders the current application state, including task lists and details, based on data from the Core Engine.

## Key Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Components are designed to be independent and interchangeable.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: `tokio` runtime is used for all I/O operations to ensure responsiveness.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and `Result` are used throughout the codebase.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Emphasis on unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- **Security**: Secure credential handling, input validation, and minimal permissions.

## Future Considerations

- Plugin architecture for extending integrations.
- Advanced TUI components for richer user experience.
- Performance optimizations for large datasets.
